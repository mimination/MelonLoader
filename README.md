GUIDE TO NAVIGATING GAME OBFUSCATION FOR MODDING PURPOSES 

SETUP:
1. DOWNLOAD MelonLoader & Realmstock to folder
C:\Users\mimi\Documents\RealmOfTheMadGod\Production
Rikkos guide as requested: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S4qmEoYrzko

2. Launch the game. Wait for the metadata error to appear, then close it.

3. Create a new folder and name it Fix.

4. COPY everything from the Production folder into your new Fix folder.

5. DOWNLOAD the toolkit from above.

6. EXTRACT all contents from MelonLoader-master and place them inside
C:\Users\mimi\Documents\RealmOfTheMadGod\Production\Fix\MelonLoader

MPORTANT NOTES:
- Make sure your new folder is specifically named Fix.
- If you run into issues, try uninstalling MelonLoader from the Production folder and reinstalling it in the Fix folder.
- All interactions with MelonLoader should occur within the Fix directory. Leave the RotMG content in the Production folder untouched.

WHY THIS WORKS:
MelonLoader isnt designed to handle obfuscation, introducing a new directory in the form of the Fix folder offers a workaround. By migrating our files and configurations to this new directory, we can bypass the obfuscation mechanisms that previously interfered with the metadata in the Production directory.
